# John Searle - Chinese Room? inspo

Do you understand me? Let's have a discussion in another language. 

(see research paper)
"Intentionality in human beings (and animals) is a product of causal features of the brain"

discussing in a foreign languages with a set of instruction. What if the human is the computer? The computer is testing you instead of you testing him? (reference to the chinese room, where one person from one room is following a set of instruction)

Also, if that person in the room provide an output that resemble reality, then can it not be define as not human in a way. 

Also in reference to the Turing Test: the user trying to determinate A & B - which one is which?

if you show an outcome do you really understand it?

Do you speak Chinese?


# The Map of the words
The Map is not the territory - the response is not the answer

The user input their questions, the machine spit out random answer from the essay of alfred korzybski The map is the territory Bernhard Siegert & Jorge Borge Luis.

This is a wink to the idea that similarly to the semantic that the map is not the territory, the speech output here doesn't necessarly provide an answer even tho it will respond. 

For the words the user will input, it will create a map, like a map of the world, but representating the map the the words.
